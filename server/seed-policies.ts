<h2>General</h2>

<h3>What is ClinicFlow?</h3>
<p>ClinicFlow is a digital platform that helps patients book consultation tokens at hospitals/clinics, track queues in real time, and get updates about schedules. <strong>Important:</strong> ClinicFlow is not a hospital or healthcare provider and does not charge or collect consultation fees.</p>

<h3>Do I need to pay to use ClinicFlow?</h3>
<p>Yes. ClinicFlow charges a small platform fee when you book a token. This fee covers booking, notifications, and real-time tracking services. The consultation fee must be paid directly at the hospital/clinic.</p>

<h3>Can I use ClinicFlow without creating an account?</h3>
<p>No. Registration is required to book tokens, receive updates, and track your appointment.</p>

<h2>Booking & Tokens</h2>

<h3>How do I book a token?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Log in to ClinicFlow</li>
<li>Search for your hospital/doctor</li>
<li>Select an available schedule</li>
<li>Pay the ClinicFlow platform fee</li>
<li>You'll receive your token number instantly</li>
</ol>

<h3>Do I need to pay the consultation fee in the app?</h3>
<p>No. Consultation fees are collected directly by the hospital/clinic at the time of your visit. ClinicFlow does not handle or process consultation fee payments.</p>

<h3>Can I choose a specific consultation time?</h3>
<p>No. Tokens are sequential. You will get an estimated consultation time based on doctor arrival and average consultation duration.</p>

<h3>What if I am late for my token?</h3>
<p>If you are late, hospital staff may place your token on "Hold" and allow you later (depending on hospital policy), or your token may be cancelled.</p>

<h3>What if the doctor is late?</h3>
<p>You'll get notified when the doctor arrives, and your estimated consultation time will be adjusted.</p>

<h2>Cancellations</h2>

<h3>How can I cancel my token?</h3>
<p>Go to My Bookings > Select Token > Cancel. Tokens must be cancelled before consultation starts.</p>

<h3>Can I reschedule my token?</h3>
<p>Rescheduling depends on the hospital's policy. Some hospitals allow it, others require a new booking.</p>

<h3>What if the doctor cancels the schedule?</h3>
<p>You'll be notified instantly. Your ClinicFlow platform fee will be refunded automatically. Any consultation fee paid at the hospital must be claimed directly from the hospital.</p>

<h2>Payments & Refunds</h2>

<h3>What payments are made in ClinicFlow?</h3>
<p>You only pay the ClinicFlow platform fee through the app. The consultation fee is paid separately at the hospital.</p>

<h3>When will I get a refund?</h3>
<p>Refunds apply only to the ClinicFlow platform fee. You are eligible if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The doctor/hospital cancels the schedule</li>
<li>You cancel your token within the hospital's allowed cancellation window</li>
</ul>

<h3>When am I not eligible for a refund?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you do not show up</li>
<li>If you cancel after the consultation has started</li>
<li>If hospital rules mark your cancellation as ineligible</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long does it take to get my refund?</h3>
<p>Eligible ClinicFlow platform fee refunds will be processed within 5–7 business days back to your original payment method.</p>

<h2>Notifications & Updates</h2>

<h3>What notifications will I receive?</h3>
<p>You'll get real-time notifications for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token booking start</li>
<li>Doctor arrival</li>
<li>Token progress (start, hold, pause, cancel)</li>
<li>Schedule changes</li>
<li>Travel-time reminders (if location enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can I turn off notifications?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can adjust notification preferences in the app, but we recommend keeping them enabled to avoid missing critical updates.</p>

<h2>Privacy & Security</h2>

<h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
<p>Yes. ClinicFlow uses encryption and secure servers. Your data is shared only with the hospital/doctor you book with.</p>

<h3>Can I delete my account?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can request account deletion via Settings > Account > Delete Account or contact support.</p>

<h3>Does ClinicFlow track my location?</h3>
<p>Only if you enable location services. Location is used for travel-time reminders to help you arrive on time.</p>`,
