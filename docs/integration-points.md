   - Consultation payment
   - Invoicing and receipts
   - Payment history tracking

2. **Potential Gateways**:
   - Stripe
   - PayPal
   - Razorpay
   - Local payment processors

3. **Implementation Requirements**:
   - Secure payment processing
   - Transaction recording
   - Receipt generation
   - Refund handling

### SMS and Email Notification Services

Extending notifications beyond in-app alerts:

1. **SMS Integration**:
   - Appointment reminders
   - Doctor arrival notifications
   - Token progress alerts
   - Status change notifications

2. **Email Integration**:
   - Appointment confirmations
   - Detailed reports
   - Monthly summaries
   - Administrative notifications

3. **Implementation Options**:
   - Twilio for SMS
   - SendGrid/Mailgun for email
   - Custom SMTP integration
   - Template system for notifications

### Calendar Integration

Syncing with external calendar systems:

1. **Supported Calendars**:
   - Google Calendar
   - Microsoft Outlook
   - Apple Calendar
   - Other iCal compatible systems

2. **Features**:
   - Two-way synchronization
   - Appointment details
   - Reminders and alerts
   - Availability checking

### Telemedicine Integration

Adding virtual consultation capabilities:

1. **Features**:
   - Video consultation
   - Secure messaging
   - Document sharing
   - Virtual waiting room

2. **Integration Options**:
   - Custom WebRTC implementation
   - Zoom API integration
   - Twilio Video
   - Microsoft Teams or Google Meet

### Lab and Diagnostic Integration

Connecting with laboratory and diagnostic centers:

1. **Features**:
   - Test ordering
   - Result viewing
   - Report integration
   - Electronic requisitions

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - HL7 or FHIR standards for medical data
   - Lab-specific APIs
   - Secure document transfer
   - Result notification system

## Data Exchange Standards

For seamless integrations, the following standards should be implemented:

1. **Healthcare Data**:
   - HL7 FHIR for medical data exchange
   - DICOM for imaging (if applicable)
   - CCDA for clinical documents

2. **General Data**:
   - REST API with JSON payloads
   - OAuth2 for authentication
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
   - JWT for tokens

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### API Gateway

Implementing an API gateway would provide:
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Request validation
- Logging and monitoring
- API versioning

### Identity Provider

Enhanced authentication options:
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- Multi-factor authentication
- Single sign-on (SSO)
- Role-based access control

### Data Pipeline

For analytics and reporting:
- ETL processes for data extraction
- Data warehousing
- Business intelligence tools
- Reporting engines

## Integration Architecture

A microservices approach to integration would include:
